# Pong Clone

This is a clone of the classic game pong, with a few added features. This is not my original idea. The clone is created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and requires a live server for the game to run. You use your mouse to control the paddle on the left. If the ball gets past you or your computer opponent a point is scored. The score is kept at the top of the screen, left is yours, right is your opponents. For a fun added twist on the original, the background has a fun color change feature. This code is based on the project originally created by freeCodeCamp on Youtube.
